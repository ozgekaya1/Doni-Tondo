# Orchestra Knowledge Graph Enrichment Project

Welcome to the Orchestra Knowledge Graph Enrichment Project! ðŸŽ» This project aims to enrich the ArCo knowledge graph with comprehensive information about orchestras, their compositions, conductors, and performances. By leveraging SPARQL queries and Large Language Models (LLMs), we seek to enhance the cultural heritage data related to orchestral music.

## Project Objectives
Our primary objectives for this project include:
- Querying and exploring the ArCo knowledge graph to identify orchestra-related data.
- Enriching the existing data by leveraging LLMs to extract additional information.
- Developing a visually appealing website to present our findings and methodologies.
